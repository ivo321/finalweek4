# finalweek4

This is the final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.
I've created a R project in RStudio
I've downoladed the Data Source to my personal computer.
Then, I've created the file run_analysis.R
Finally, I've registered all the commands in the file, step by step according to what was requested.
